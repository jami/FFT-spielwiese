==============

Little JS FFT, DFT, DCT, DST example area. Its useful if you want to know how to transform time domain signal data to frequency domain data. The algorithm implementations are far away from being fast! Thats not the goal. My goal is an overview about fourier analysis algorithmes with nice little interactive examples. To help me and you to understand this black arcanian mumbo jumbo digital signal processing mathematic. Its really hard but you can do cool stuff with it :) Feel free to fork or give me tips and hints
